║    This document explains how to properly set up a Raspberry Pi mini computer  ║
║    to act as a Concerto client machine. The basic goal of this is to have a    ║
║    device that, upon starting, will automatically start a Chromium browser in  ║
║    fullscreen and send it to the Concerto web page containing the device's     ║
║    specific contents. We also wish to hide the mouse cursor and prevent the    ║
║    device from going to sleep due to inactivity. Also, if the Chromium browser ║
║    were to crash or close, we want to automatically restart the browser as     ║
║    soon as possible.                                                           ║

║    a. Required materials and software                                          ║
║        - Raspberry Pi Model B and a 5V-1A MicroUSB Power Supply                ║
║        - Standard SD card 4GB or more (class 6 or better)                      ║
╨        - Raspbery Pi's Wheezy Linux Distro OS                                  ╨

╥                                                                                ╥
║    b. Installing the OS                                                        ║
║        - Begin by first formatting the SD card.This can be either a full       ║
║          format or a quick format. If the SD is already formatted then you     ║
║          don't need to bother.                                                 ║
║        - Next run the Win32 Disk Imager program with Adminstrative Privileges. ║
║          Select the drive letter for the SD card and open the Wheezy .img      ║
║          file. Once that's done click the [Write] button.                      ║
║        - Once the program finishes your SD card will now contain the Wheezy    ║
║          OS. The next thing is to test it to make sure it works.               ║
║        - Place the card in the Raspberry Pi and start it up. If it works       ║
║          great! If not, try reinstalling the OS.                               ║
║        - Once the Pi starts up for the first time you will see a blue screen   ║
║          menu. This is for the initial Pi system setup. You can adjust the     ║
║          system timezone, keyboard layout etc. Make sure that the SSH is       ║
║          enabled so you can remote connect to it later on.                     ║
║        - Once you're finished setting that up and have left the menu you will  ║
║          eventually reach a prompt. If you are asked to log in the default     ║
║          user and password are as follows:                                     ║
║              user: pi                                                          ║
║              pass: raspberry                                                   ║
║        - Once your at the "pi@raspberrypi ~ $" prompt, enter the 'startx'      ║
║          command. This will begin the Wheezy GUI program which eventually give ║
║          you a nice desktop and mouse.                                         ║
║        - At this point you are done. When the desktop starts up you can        ║
║          proceed to section 3. Setting up Concerto.                            ║

║             either downloading the ConcertoForPi.zip from a network location   ║

║         For this you will need the .script and .shoutcast files. This script   ║
║         is what automates opening the Chromium browser to the Concerto web page║
║         and making sure the computer does not fall asleep.                     ║

║           - First copy the .script file to the home folder. If you're not sure ║
║             where that is, enter the following into a terminal: echo $HOME     ║
║           - Rename the file to "digitalsignage.sh"                             ║
║           - Next, open the file in a text editor and just after the line       ║
║             'LOG="./digitalsignage.log"' add the following on its own line:    ║
╟───────────────┤ConcertoServerIP="<CONCERTO_URL>"├──────────────────────────────╢
║           - Replacing <CONCERTO_URL> with either the web URL or IP address of  ║

║           (ShoutCast Script)                                                   ║
║           - First copy the .shoutcast file to the home folder. If you're not   ║
║             sure where that is, enter the following into a terminal:echo $HOME ║
║           - Rename the file to "shoutcast-radio.sh"                            ║
║           - Next, open the file in a text editor and just after the first two  ║
║             lines (which are just file comments) add the following on its own  ║
║             line: shoutcast_radio_link="<SHOUTCAST_URL>"                       ║
║           - Replacing <SHOUTCAST_URL> with either the web URL or IP address    ║
║             and port of the Concerto server.                                   ║
║           - Save the document and move on to the next step.                    ║
║     III. Setting up the Cron Job                                               ║

╟────────────────┤crontab -eu $USER├─────────────────────────────────────────────╢
║           - You should now see a command line text editor. Scroll down to the  ║
║             bottom of the file and add the following line (include every       ║
║             character including the *s):                                       ║
╟───────┤* * * * * export DISPLAY=:0 && /bin/bash $HOME/digitalsignage.sh├───────╢
║             (For ShoutCast also add the following line beneath the previous)   ║
╟───────┤@reboot /bin/bash $HOME/shoutcast-radio.sh &> $HOME/shoutcast-radio.log├╢
║             (For the automatic daily reboot, add the following as well)        ║
╟───────┤M H * * * sudo reboot├──────────────────────────────────────────────────╢
║             (Replace 'M' with a minute value 0-59.)                            ║

║           - Once done, save the document and close. If the editor does not     ║
║             show instructions on how to do so it is most likely the 'vim'      ║
║             editor. To exit hit [Esc] and then enter ':x' and hit enter. That  ║
║             should save and close the document.                                ║
